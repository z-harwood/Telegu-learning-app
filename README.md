üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Development
This project is a single index.html file but uses modern tools for development and packaging.

Prerequisites
Node.js: Download & Install Node.js

Android Studio: Download & Install Android Studio for Android packaging.

A Firebase Project: You will need a free Firebase project to handle user progress saving.

Local Development
Because the app uses JavaScript modules, you need to serve it from a local web server to test it in your browser.

Place the index.html file in a project folder.

Open a terminal in that folder.

Run the following command (requires Python): python -m http.server

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.

Packaging for Android
This project uses Capacitor to wrap the web app in a native Android shell. The guide.md file in this repository contains a full, step-by-step guide for this process.

üíª Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (ESM)

Animation: D3.js

Backend & Database: Google Firebase (Firestore & Anonymous Authentication)
